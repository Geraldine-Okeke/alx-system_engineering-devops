Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent future incidents, we will implement the following corrective and preventative measures:
- Review all database configuration updates before deployment to ensure there are no errors.
- Implement automated testing of database configuration updates before deployment to catch errors early.
- Review monitoring alerts to ensure they are set up correctly and can detect similar issues in the future.
- Create a post-incident review process to analyze and learn from the incident, and implement any necessary changes to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
